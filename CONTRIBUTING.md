Welcome, we are a kind, open-minded, simple community. All help welcome, in any way you can think of.

## Coding
**Remmina** uses the [fork and pull](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11582995/what-is-the-fork-pull-model-in-github) model.
If you&#8217;d like to make changes to this project, the following steps will get you there!

  1. Fork [this repo](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/forks/new)
  2. Make your changes
  3. [Submit a merge request](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/merge_requests/new)

The [wiki](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/wikis/home) has details on how to compile Remmina and FreeRDP.
Look for issues labeled [&#8220;help wanted&#8221;](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/issues?label_name%5B%5D=help+wanted). There are also paid bounties available.
Know how to fix a bug or implement anything requested or completely new, but lack the time? Get in touch, **We can pay for some hours of your time. Don't be shy.**

### Fix existing bugs
In general, this is the most important task.
To see all the issues already labeled as bugs, you can use [this query](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/issues?label_name%5B%5D=bug)

### Implement most wanted features and fixes (_bounty $305_)
Similarly, we have a quite important list of feature requests, that are labeled as [enhancement](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/issues?label_name%5B%5D=enhancement&sort=created_date&state=opened), of which some that have a [bounty](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=enhancement&label_name[]=bounty) for those that will be able to implement them.
  * [#476](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/issues/476) : Favorite and recent connections [$5]
  * [#376](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/issues/376) : RDP: Multi monitor support [$15]

### Internal projects
  * Refactoring [remmina\_connection\_window.cpp](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina/blob/master/src/remmina_connection_window.cpp) as it is big, complicated and hard to extend.
  * Simplify the user interface.
  * Separate plugin processes from the main process to improve stability.
  * Write an additional plugin system to write plugins also in Python and eventually Ruby.

## Documentation
Submit user and developer guides in any (accessible) format you want (screencasts, PDF, HTML, Open Document, .gs, .ps, LaTeX, GitLab wiki , etc).

- Cration of and connection to a VNC server.
- Using a basic SSH tunnel.
